This repository contains ligand-only Random Forest Regression models for affinity predictions to Solute Carrier family protein SLC15a2 (PEPT2). This work is a continuation of the research of Dr Simon Lichtinger and files xxx are copied from his directory. 

This research, for my part II project in Biochemistry, aims to assess the validity of different evaluation techniques on small training sets and understand the impacts of model bias. We hope to optimise Dr Lichtinger's Random Forest model to reduce overfitting and implement a post-hoc filter to evaluate the nature of predicted PEPT2 binders - substrate or inhibitor. The structure of the repo is detailed below and a * highlights work that is ongoing.
